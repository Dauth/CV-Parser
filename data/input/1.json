This BCI system requires only two electrodes, and has a relatively short training time for both the user and the machine. This will be greatly beneficial for paralytic patients.\nAuto tracking of movement of a mouse in a maze using LabVIEW:\n\n\fMay 2009 to May 2010 Members:Yamini B., vinoth S., Uma Bhavani, Thenmozhi\nDesigned and constructed a system to automatically track the movements of mice in an 8 arm radial maze. We used IR sensors fitted into the sides of each arm of the maze and connected that to a PCB which was connected to the computer with LabVIEW. This maze is designed to perform studies on the spatial learning and memory of rodents. The basic information necessary to the researchers is the entry of the mouse in each arm and the time spent by the mouse in each arm. Using the analog circuit as well as LabVIEW we were able to provide the above information.\nDesign of a motion capture system for upper limb movement analysis March 2011 to December 2011 Members:Yamini B.\nDesigned an optimal system to track the upper limb movement of normal subjects performing activities of daily living using Qualysis Motion Tracking system and addressed issues such as occlusion of markers and space constraints to provide a stable and reliable system for future trials to be conducted on stroke patients in hospitals.\nHonors and Awards First place in paper presentation at national level technical symposium Anna University March 2009\nPresented a paper titled \"Use of biomaterials in tissue engineering\" and was awarded the first place for that\n\n\fpresentation.\nSecond place in paper presentation at inter collegiate symposium Jerusalem College of Engineering September 2008\nPresented a paper titled \"Use of Neural Networks in Breast Cancer Detection\"\nFirst place in poster designing competition Bannari Amman Institute of Technology October 2009\nDesigned a poster on the theme \"Global opportunites and challenges of Technical Students\" in the 12th ISTE Students' National Convention.\nVolunteer Experience Volunteer teacher at SINDA\nAugust 2011 - Present (4 years 3 months)\nConduct reading classes for children on weekends to help them improve their english reading skills.\nCertifications RCULA\nSkills & Expertise Matlab Labview\n\n\fBiomedical Engineering Image Processing Microsoft Office Biomaterials Molecular Biology Medical Devices Microsoft Excel Medical Research Qualysis Motion Capture Data Mining Real-time Data Acquisition Photoshop\nEducation Nanyang Technological University MSc, Biomedical Engineering, 2010 - 2011 Anna University Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.), Biomedical/Medical Engineering, 2006 - 2010 Activities and Societies: Student council, NGO-Third Vision Bishop Cotton's womens christian college 2004 - 2006 Activities and Societies: Modelling, Dancing\nInterests Animals, writing, reading, artwork, travelling\nLocation 131 Whitecross Street, London\n\n\f\f"]
