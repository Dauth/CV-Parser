April 2013 to Present

Members:Russell O., Yat Pan Ng

ZeroIN is the first context-aware, intelligent messaging app for the car. It uses your personal

smartphone

to keep email distractions to a minimum, no matter what car you're in. Only messages that are

important,

contain actionable content and merit attention are read out, and drivers can simply respond by voice

-- to

keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. Stay connected to what's important - ZeroIN

restricts

incoming messages to just those from important contacts, and then distills the content to just the

parts that
require your attention.  Take action safely ­ reply to both incoming and pending action items via

voice.
